The circuit that was developed in task 4 will be used for the purposes of this circuit development section. The output stage will be added in this task which will be a class B amplifier. The class B amplifier will consist of a 2n3904 NPN BJT and a 2n3906 PNP BJT. The simulations were conducted in Microcap 10. As these schematics are difficult to read, a set of schematics with identical values and components were created in Eagle by Autodesk. The simulated schematic can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:simschem} below.
