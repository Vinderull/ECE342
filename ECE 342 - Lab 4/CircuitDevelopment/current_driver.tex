The current driver for this lab was created using an MCP6004 op amp. The op amp is to act as the driver for the gate of a 2N3904 Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT). The generic circuit for the signal conditioner is shown in Figure \ref{fig:currentgeneric}.

The key to operation of the current driver is the BJT transistor. A BJT transistor, in contrast with the metal oxide semiconducting field effect transistor (MOSFET), is capable of
