\noindent This report describes design, implementation and test of an LED driver comprised of a ring oscillator, Schmitt trigger, and a current driver. The ring oscillator is comprised of complementary metal oxide semiconducting field effect transistors (CMOS) inverters connected in series. Figure \ref{fig:blockdiagram2} demonstrates where in the optical uplink project the LED driver is placed.

The LED driver is required by the optical uplink project. The signal generator chosen for the overall design does not output a high enough current in order to operate the IR LED. In addition, the waveform from the signal generator is a distorted sinuisoid without a 50\% duty-cycle. For ideal operation, the LED should receive a 50\% duty-cycle square wave. In addition, it requires a forward voltage of at least 100mA in order to operate.. The specifications for this lab are summarized in Table \ref{tab:specifications}.

The LED driver circuit supplies the LED with a controlled current. A signal conditioner takes the output from a ring oscillator and creates a 50\% duty-cycle square wave. The square wave is then in turn recieved by a current driver. The current driver creates a sufficiently large current in order to operate the LED.  A voltage driven output to light the LED is not used due to increased sensitivity from temperature change. 


Section 2 of this report describes the design and simulations of the signal conditioner and the current driver. Experimental results are addressed in section 3. A discussion of the results, sources of error, and areas of possible improvement are outlined in section 4. Section 5 concludes this report. \newline
