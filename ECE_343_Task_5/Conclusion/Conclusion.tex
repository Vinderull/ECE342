The design, simulation, and construction of experiments to measure the performance of feedback to the op amp.  The gain was measured at 63.3 dB while unloaded. The smallest value for the load resistor which caused a 3 dB drop in gain was found to be 500 $\Omega$, with a gain measured at 66.33 dB. The unity gain uncompensated unity gain frequency was measured at 170 kHz. This circuit will help the circuit achieve and maintain stability of the operational amplifier in task 6.  An important lesson learned during this lab was that achieving a gain too high over specification is not helpful when trying to measure values and achieving stability, which is as important as the final gain value.
