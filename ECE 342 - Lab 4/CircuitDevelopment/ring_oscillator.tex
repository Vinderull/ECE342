The design of the CMOS ring oscillator consists of three CMOS inverters connected in series with the
output of the last inverter connected to the input of the first inverter. The ring oscillator will also have a
capacitor at each output connected to ground. The schematic for the CMOS ring oscillator can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:ringoscillatorcmosexp}.

The operation of the ring oscillator uses a series of inverters. The output of one inverter inverts the input signal. Therefore, if there are a series of inverters, then each odd inverter will have the same inverted output as the first. In this instance, there are three stages of inverters used, with the output of the third inverter being fed back into the input of the first inverter. This feedback from the output to the input causes an oscillation. The simulated output of the ring oscillator is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ringoscsimlab4}.

The ring oscillator circuit requires only a DC power source with a threshold voltage above what is required of the MOSFETS, and the oscillations will occur. To increase the frequency, the DC supply can be increased, causing an increase in current as well as frequency.
