This section covers the design choices associated with the various circuits constructed. Both a NMOS common source amplifier and BJT common emitter amplifier. Only the NMOS circuit required design choices as the BJT component values were provided as part of the lab.

The order in which the circuits are discussed is as follows: first the NMOS amplifier followed by the BJT amplifier.
