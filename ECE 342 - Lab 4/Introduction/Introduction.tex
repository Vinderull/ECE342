This report describes the design, implementation and test of an LED (light emmitting diode) driver. 

\noindent This report describes design, implementation and test of an LED driver comprised of a ring oscillator, schmitt trigger, and a current driver. The ring oscillator is comprised of complementary metal oxide semiconducting field effect transistors (CMOS) inverters connected in series. Figure \ref{fig:blockdiagram2} demonstrates where in the optical uplink project the LED driver is placed.

The LED driver circuit supplies the LED with a controlled current. A voltage driven output to light the LED is not used due to increased sensitivity from temperature change.
