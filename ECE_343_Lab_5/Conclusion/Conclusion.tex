The design, simulation, and construction of experiments to measure the performance of feedback to the op amp. The FINAL VALUES GO HERE. This circuit will help the circuit achieve and maintain stability of the operational amplifier in task 6.  An important lesson learned during this lab was that achieving a gain too high over specification is not helpful when trying to measure values and achieving stability, which is as important as the final gain value(ADD TO / CHANGE THIS).
