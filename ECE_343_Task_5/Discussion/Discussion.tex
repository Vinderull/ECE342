After several minor changes, the op amp operated correctly. The largest change that had to be made was the inclusiion of a 150 pF capacitor at the outout of the common source amplifier stage. The inclusion of this capacitor change the pole location such that the 0dB crossing point now occured prior to the 180$^\circ$ phase shift location. Prior to this change the amplifier was unstable and did not have a zero crossing that was in the range of the Digilent's Network analyzer, despite the fact that the 180$^\circ$ phase occured at about 200 kHz. Some of the other possible locations for this capacitor include across the drains of the active load amplifier and at the input of the common source amplifier. The location that worked the best for the purposes of this lab was the output of the common source amplifier.

 This lab also served as introduction to feedback applications of operational amplifiers. The op amp was configured into both inverting and non-inverting topologies. In these two configurations the op amp is expected to behave like any commericial op amp that has been used in ECE 214 and ECE 342. The specifications are outlined in Table \ref{tab:specs}.

Feedback can be used to improve the performance of the circuit depending on which configuration is chosen by the designer. The stability of the circuit can be improved with the correct setup. One of the largest advantages offered by feedback is the improvement it provides to both in the input and output resistance of the amplifier. An ideal voltage amplifier has infinited input impedence and zero output impedence. For the discrete circuit implemented this not the case. With the use of feedback the input impendence can be increased by a factor of $1+A\beta$ while decreasing the output impenedence by the same factor.

The final circuits fell well within specifications and operated correctly after minor component alterations.
