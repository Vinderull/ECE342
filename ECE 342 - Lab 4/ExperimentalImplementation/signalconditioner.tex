The signal conditioner required several small changes in order to be functional. The 100k$\Omega$ resistor voltage divider was switched to a 10k$\Omega$ potentiometer in order to facilitate easier adjustment of the output duty-cycle. The resistors in the feedback configuration were changed to 10k$\Omega$ and 100k$\Omega$. This was done in order to minimize the loading effects between the signal conditioner and the current driver. The output waveform is shown in Fig \ref{fig:conditionedvoltagelab4}.

The output waveform operated with a 4.5V peak, 20.26kHz and 45\% duty-cycle.
