Ryan, Phil and Joseph have completed, at the time of this proposal, five semesters in the electical and computer engineering discipline. The most relevant skillsets for the purposes of this proposal is from the electronics course, ECE 342, which an optical uplink was simulated and designed by this team. This course focused primarily on microelecronic circuits and in-depth study of MOSFET's, BJT's and their implementation in circuits with operational amplifiers. 

Ryan and Phil are double majoring in Computer and Electrical engineering at the University of Maine. Both have relevant skills from coursework in Microcomputer Architecture and Design, ECE 473, which implements Verilog in design of Microprocessors, which is of use when designing hardware for the tripwire. Joseph is an
undergraduate majoring in electrical engineering at the University of Maine.
