The design, simulation, and implementation of the ring oscillator signal generator have been explained. NMOS inverters, CMOS inverters, and logic gates were also investigated. Lab specification required that the signal generator have a frequency of approximately 20kHz, a duty-cycle of approximately 50\%, and an amplitude of 5V. The signal generator takes an input DC voltage and creates an sinusoidal waveform at the output. The signal generator circuit was constructed using the following parts: three 8.2nF capacitors, a 4.7nF capacitor; and finally a CD4007 CMOS integrated circuit with 5V supply voltages. The frequency was 19.8kHz, with a duty-cycle of 51\%, and an amplitude of 4.9V. 
%%IMPORTANT LESSON
An important lesson about the behavior real logic circuits was learned. Real digital circuits have measurable electrical characteristics and do not behave ideally.
