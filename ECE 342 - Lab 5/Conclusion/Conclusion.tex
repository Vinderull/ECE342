	The design, simulation, and implementation of a voltage amplifier have been explained. The specifications required, for the purposes of use in the optical uplink project, are a lower cutoff frequency of $\le$ 1kHz, upper cutoff frequency of 200 kHz, and a peak gain of 21 dB $\pm$ 1 dB. Also, the 2nd Harmonic distortion for a 20 mVp-p sinusoidal signal at 1 kHz must be < 2\%. The sinusoidal source was 20 mV$_{P-P}$ at 1kHz, and the supply voltages were $\pm$ 12V. This resulted in a lower cutoff frequency of approximately 600 Hz and the upper cutoff frequency was in the MHz range, which exceeds the required $\ge$ 200 kHz. The 2nd harmonic distortion was measured to be approximately 5\%. An important lesson was learned about the comparison between a voltage amplifier using NMOS components and a voltage amplifier using BJT components.
