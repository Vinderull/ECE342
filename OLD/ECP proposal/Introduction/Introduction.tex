The Optical Uplink project was finalized with the implementation of an LED signal transmitter with a separate receiver/amplifier module. The entire device acts as a rudimentary wireless communication device capable of transmission over tens of meters.

An infrared sensor, widely known as a tripwire, is a popular device that has many applications, notably in both military and retail. In this proposal, the use of IR as trigger method for IR will be considered, and the importance of tripwire sensors in retail will be discussed.

Section 2 provides the background for the tripwire device. Section 3 describes the proposed work. Section 4 outlines the preliminary results. Section 5 details the qualfications of the design team. Section 6 gives the cost analysis of the device and Section 7 concludes this proposal.
