This section details the experimental implementation of the two differential amplifiers, the resistively loaded and active loaded. The power supplies and analysis were implemented using the Digilent Analog Discovery kit.

The experimental circuit can be seen Figure \ref{fig:expercircuit}.

The simulated circuit, when constructed, failed to meet both the final differential gain output of 46 dB as well as the CMRR of 60 dB. As a result the final circuit design was changed to the op amp design #1, which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:expercircuit}. Further details on why design was changed can be found in the Discussion section.

The DC bias conditions were measured using a DT830B DVM. Nodal voltages were measured in reference to ground and current was measured by wiring the DVM in series while in ammeter mode. The bias conditions were measured while both input nodes to the circuit were grounded. The final measured values can be seen in Table \ref{tab:expdc}.

	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
		\hline
		\textbf{DC Bias Conditions} &           \\ \hline
		Vref                        & -3.03V    \\ \hline
		Iref                        & 396$\mu$A \\ \hline
		D1                          & 2.01V     \\ \hline
		D2                          & 1.99V     \\ \hline
		S                           & -2.04V    \\ \hline
		OutCS                       & 100mV      \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Notably, the voltage at the "OutCS" node should be zero. In the default state, the offset at that node was measured to be 2.5V. A potentiometer was used as the source degeneration resistance for the common source amplifier. This pot was varied until the offset was nulled out and the final resistance value required was found to be 1.5k$\Omega$.
